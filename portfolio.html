                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>My project on obtaining flight tickets at low cost using C++ likely involves implementing algorithms
                    or systems to search for and suggest affordable flight options. Your program could utilize
                    techniques such as web scraping for pricing data, analyzing historical trends, or employing
                    optimization algorithms to find the most cost-effective routes. Additionally, you might incorporate
                    user input for preferences like date flexibility or budget constraints. The goal is to empower users
                    to make informed decisions and secure economical flight tickets efficiently through your C++
                    application.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The database project for a banking system encompasses the development of a comprehensive platform to
                    manage customer accounts, transactions, and banking operations efficiently. This project involves
                    creating tables to store customer information such as names, addresses, contact details, account
                    types, and balances. It also includes functionalities for opening, closing, and modifying accounts,
                    as well as recording transaction details like transaction IDs, amounts, dates, and types. Security
                    measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption are implemented to ensure data
                    integrity and protect sensitive information. Additionally, the project incorporates reporting and
                    analytics features to generate financial statements, transaction histories, and performance reports.
                    The user interface is designed to be user-friendly for bank employees, facilitating account
                    management, transaction processing, and administrative tasks. Overall, the project aims to provide a
                    scalable, secure, and efficient database solution for managing a banking system's operations
                    effectively.</p>

                <h3>Project 3 </h3>
                <p>The basic web-based application for a bank serves as an online platform for customers to access
                    banking services conveniently and securely. It includes features such as account management, fund
                    transfers, bill payments, and transaction history tracking. Users can log in securely using
                    authentication methods like username/password or biometric authentication for added security. The
                    application is designed with a responsive and intuitive user interface to ensure compatibility
                    across devices like desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It also incorporates encryption
                    protocols to safeguard sensitive data during transmission. Overall, the web-based banking
                    application enhances customer experience by providing easy access to essential banking
                    functionalities anytime, anywhere, with robust security measures in place.</p>
